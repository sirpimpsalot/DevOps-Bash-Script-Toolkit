## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by opening a confidential issue or emailing the maintainer. Do **not** disclose security issues publicly until they have been reviewed and patched.

- Include steps to reproduce if possible
- Suggest a possible fix if you have one

## Security Best Practices
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials in scripts
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Validate all user input
